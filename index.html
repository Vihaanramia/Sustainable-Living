		<h2 class="center">What Is Sustainable Living</h2>

		<p>Sustainable living is buying items made using recycled materials or designed to be zero-waste that help the enviornment. 
			<br>
			Doing that helps the world become a better place.
			<br>
		The benefit for you is you can spen less money on things you buy by recycling and putting a less harmful impact on the earth </p>
	</div>
	<div id="Differences">

		<h2 class="center">Differences</h2>
		<p>Sustainable living and the zero-waste movement have similar goals and many similar lifestyle patterns, but are a little bit different. Those trying to live sustainably aim to lower their overall environmental impact in a variety of ways, while the primary focus of those living zero-waste is typically to reduce the amount of trash they produce, namely single-use plastic</p>

		<p>For example, someone whose primary goal is to live zero-waste and produce zero trash may be comfortable eating meat that was purchased without any plastic. But someone aiming to live a well-rounded, sustainable lifestyle may consider the bigger picture (aka the massive environmental impact and ethical concerns of animal agriculture) and opt for a plant- based meal instead, even if it is packaged in plastic.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="Start">
		<h2 class="center">How To Start Sustainable Living?</h2>

		<p>There are numerous ways to start living more sustainably — and a sustainable lifestyle looks different for everyone. Areas where you can reduce your impact include:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Eating A Plant Based Diet </th>
				<th>Composting</th>
				<th>Reducing Single Used Plastic</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><p>The diet consists primarily of food made of plants: fruits and vegetables in addition to nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes. A plant-based diet is not a vegetarian or vegan diet; you can eat poultry, beef, eggs, fish, and dairy products, however most of your nutrient intake is coming from plant-based food sources.:</p></td>

				<td><p>Composting is the process of recycling organic materials into an amendment that can be used to enrich soil and plants. You can compost cat litter and plants and many other items that are disposable do not compost plastics or metals.:</p></td>

				<td><p>Carrying reusable bags and bottles is one great way to avoid single-use plastics in our day-to-day lives Recycling more plastic, more frequently can help reduce single use plastic pleas try to reduce the single use plastic so the earth can stay green and healthy because the trash that we throw away into the roads and oceans is very harmful to the enviornment. Please try to help:</p></td>
			</tr>

				<th>Transportation </th>
				<th>Shopping</th>

				<td><p>The different modes of transport are air, water, and land transport, which includes rails or railways, road and off-road transport. Other modes of transport also exist, including pipelines, cable transport, and space transport.:</p></td>

				Use recycled packaging, Use reusable bags, Buy Big, Check out your local farmers market, Clean naturally using the natural materials, Recycle old goods, reduce waste, Upcycle:</p></td>

	<div id="impact">
		<h2 class="center">Impact</h2>

		<p>Living sustainably can improve our life balance by reducing our dependence on vehicles or machinery. By being less reliant on vehicles, we're more likely to walk or cycle, which helps us create healthier habits. We can also live healthier lives by consuming high-quality, local foods.</p>

		<p>For example, reducing our reliance on natural resources protects habitats and limits competition for resources with wildlife, whilst mitigating human wildlife conflict builds tolerance and coexistence, reducing our impact on wildlife populations and protecting peoples' livelihoods.</p>

		<p>Environmentally, sustainable practices can help protect natural resources, mitigate and adapt to climate change and promote biodiversity. At the environmental level, sustainability prevents nature from being used as an inexhaustible source of resources and ensures its protection and rational use.</p>

		<h2 class="center"> What People Can Do</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Grow Food</h3>
				<p>If you plan ahead, you can start vegetable seeds indoors, then transplant indoor vegetables outdoors and shorten the wait. Transplants – Also known as starter plants, these young plants offer faster harvests, but you're limited to what nurseries or garden centers choose to grow.There are two basic methods to plant: by planting seeds directly into the ground or by using transplants (or 'starts') that you have purchased or grown indoors. When a spring crop is finished, you can replant that square with a summer crop, and later for a fall crop.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Preserve Food</h3>
				<p>Cold Storage Methods. This involves storing food in refrigerators within cool, dark places like root cellars. ...
					Drying the Food, 
					Canning Techniques, 
					Freezing Items, 
					Try Sun-Drying, 
					Add Some Salt or Sugar, 
					Preserve Food With Alcohol, 
				Pickle With Vinegar.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Reduce Waste</h3>
				<p>Reusable bags and containers, 
					Reuse water bottles, coffee mugs, and plates too, 
					Skip on individually wrapped items, specifically food in snack packs or single-serving containers, 
					Start composting in the kitchen and yard, 
					Pay your bills online, 
					Go paperless in the kitchen too, 
				Recycle more!Reducing waste can be as simple as using both sides of a sheet of paper, using ceramic mugs instead of disposable cups, or buying in bulk rather than individually packaged items. The end result for producing less waste is money saved, resources conserved, pollution reduced, and landfill space saved.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Insulate Houses</h3>
				<p>As a renewable, natural material, hemp batting and hemp boards are an excellent option for eco-friendly home insulation. Hemp can easily be recycled and reused, takes very little energy or water input to grow and manufacture, and has an R-value of around 3.5 per inch.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Use Public Transport</h3>
				<p>Improve the bus transit experience through reliable and easy-to-use services
					Optimising bus routes to minimise overlap and ensure coverage across the city in line with demand. ...
					Designing an intuitive network and easy-to-read bus map. ...
					Providing high-frequency, reliable services. ...
					Building regular bus stops for easy access.
					The different modes of transport are air, water, and land transport, which includes rails or railways, road and off-road transport. Other modes of transport also exist, including pipelines, cable transport, and space transport.
