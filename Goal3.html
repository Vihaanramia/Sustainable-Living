			<h3>Why Is There So Much Poverty In The World?</h3>
			<p>Poverty has many dimensions, but its causes include unemployment, social exclusion, and high vulnerability of certain populations to disasters, diseases and other phenomena which prevent them from being productive.</p>
			<h3>Why should I care about other people’s economic situation?</h3>
			<p>There are many reasons, but in short, because as human beings, our well- being is linked to each other. Growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth and undermines social cohesion, increas- ing political and social tensions and, in some circumstances, driving instability and conflicts.</p>
			<h3>Why is social protection so important?</h3>
			<p>Strong social protection systems are essential for mitigating the effects and preventing many people from falling into poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic had both immediate and long-term economic consequences for people across the globe – and despite the expansion of social protection during the COVID-19 crisis, 55 per cent of the world’s population – about 4 billion people – are entirely unprotected.</p>

			<h3>What is the goal here?</h3>
			<p>End poverty in all its form</p>
			<h3>Why</h3>
			<p>By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $2.15 a day</p>
			<p>By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions</p>
			<p>Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable</p>
